Would it be possible to define isShorter as a constexpr? If So, do
so. If not, explain why not.

No it's not possible, due to size() method is not a constexpr and
s1.size() == s2.size() is not const expression.

A constexpr functino may only contains statements that generat no action at run time. But size must be called at run time.
