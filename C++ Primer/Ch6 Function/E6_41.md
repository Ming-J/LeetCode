Which, if any of the following calls are illegal? why? which, if any
are legal but unlikely to match the programmer's intent? Why?

````c++
char * init (int ht, int wd = 80, char bckgrnd = ' ');
````
a:
````c++
init();
````
illegal, no default value for ht

b:
````c++
init(24,10)
````
legal ht = 24, wd = 10, bckgrnd = ' '

c:
````c++
init(14,'*');
````

legal, but not the programmer's intent.

The programmer would like bckgrnd = '*', however since only two
argument were given only the first two initilize so ht =14, wd = '*'(int)
