Explain what this loop does and whether it is a good use of assert:

````c++
string s;
while( cin >> s && s != sought) {} //empty body
assert(cin)
````

There are two situtation that can exit the while loop:

1. when nothing in the cin
2. when s is equal sought

It is a bad idea to use assert check whether cin is in an error
state. Because when the program compiled with NDEBUG preprocessor
variable, the statement would not be excuted/
