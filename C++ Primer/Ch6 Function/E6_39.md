3 possible outcome when overloading function

- The compiler find exactly 1 function that is a best match for the
argument and generates code to call that function

- There is no function with parameter that match the argument in the
  call, the compile issues an error message that there was no match

- There is more than one function that matches and none of the matches
  is clearly best. This case is also an error; it is an ambiguous call


Explain the effect of the second declaration in each one of the
following set of declarations. indicate which, if any are illegal.

a)

int calc(int, int);
int calc(const int, const int);

legal, however the second function is the same as first. A parameter
that has a top level const is indistinguishable from one with out a
tiop-level const

b)

int get();
double get();

illegal, can not have two function with same parameter list to have
different return type

c)
int *reset(int *);
double *reset(double *);

legal, vaild function overloading
