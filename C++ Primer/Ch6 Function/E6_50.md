Given the declarations for f from liast the viable functions, if any
for each of the following calls. Indicate which function is the best
match, of if the call is illegal whether there is no match or why the
call is ambiguous.

a. f(2.56,42)

visible function are:
 f(int,int)
 f(double,double = 3.14)

This call is ambigous since 2.56 can convert to int and 42 can convert
to double.


b.  f(42)

visiable function are:
 f(int)
 f(double, double)

 best match is f(int), f(double,double) 42 would need to be convert.

 c. f(42,0)

 visible function are:
 f(int,int)
 f(double, double = 3.14)

 best match is f(int,int), f(double,double) need to convert

 d. f(2.56, 3.14)

 vivible function are:
 f(int,int)
 f(double, double = 3.14)

 best match is f(double, double = 3.14)
