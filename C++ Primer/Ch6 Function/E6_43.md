Which one of the following declarations and definitions would you put
in a header? In a source file? Explain why?

````c++
//a
inline bool eq(const BigInt&, const BigInt&){...}

````

For inline function declarations and defintions should be placed in a
header files and included in source files when required. The
definition of an inline function must match exactly each time it is
defined.

b
````c++
void putValues(int *arr, int size);
````

Function declarations like this should generally exist inside header
files. The definition should be in the source files.
