What does the condition in the following `if` statement do?
````c++
if(read(read(cin,data1),data2))
````

The `if` statement will be true only if there is enough data to
satisfy both `data1` and `data1`, it will be false otherwise.

Can divide it like that:
````c++
istream &firstStep = read(cin, data1);
istream &secondStep = read(firstStep, data2);
if(secondStep)
````
