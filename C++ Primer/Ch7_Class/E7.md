#7 Class

Fundamental ideas behind classes

-Data Abstraction : programming technique that relies on separation of
 inteeface and implementation.
 	   - interface : operations that user of the calss can execute
	   - implementation: data member, bodies of functions , any
	     functions that need to define the class that are not
	     intended for general use.
-Encapsulation : enforce separation of a class interface and implementation
A class that is encapsulate hides it's implementation - users of the
class can use intface but have no access to the implementation

A class that uses data abstraction and encapsulation defines an
abstract data type.
Class designer worries about how class is implementation
Programmer who use the class need not know how the type works.

# 7.1 Defining Abstract Data Type

## 7.1.2 Defining the Revised Sales_data Class

Introducing this

````c++
std:: string isbn() const {return bookNo};
````

total.isbn();  -> returning total.bookNo.

member functions access the object on which they were called through
an extra implicit parameter. this is initialized with the address of
the object on which the function was invoked.

the compiler passes the address of toal to implicit this parameter in
isbn.
total.isbn()  -> Sales_data::isbn(&total);

Inside member function, refer directly to the members of the object on
the function was called.

Direct use of a member is assumed to be an implicit reference through
this.  this -> bookNo.

Legal but unnessessary, this is a const pointer, can not change the
address.

````c++
std::string isbn() const { return this-> bookNo; }
````

#Introduction const Member Function

The const keyword that follow the parameter list. The purpose of that
const is to modify the type of the implicit this pointer.

`this` is a `const` pointer to the non`const` version of the class type.

type of this in a Sales_data is Sales_data *const.

We cannot bind `this` to a `const` object. means that we cannot call
an ordinary member function on a `const` object.

If isbn were an ordinary function and if this were an ordinary pointer
parameter, we would declare `this` as const Sales_data *const. the
body of isbn doesn;t change the object to which this points, so our
function would be more flexible if `this` were a pointer to `const`.

Since `this` is implicit and does not appear in the parameter
list. There is no place to indicate that this should be a pointer to
const. The language resloved this by letting us put `const` after the
parameter list of a member function. A `const` following the parameter
list indicates that `this` is a pointer to `const`. Member functions
that use `const` this wat are const member functions.

````c++
//psuedo-code illustration of how the implicit this pointer is use
//this code is illegal: we may not explicitly define the this pointer
//ourselves note that this is a pointer to const because isbn is a
//const member
std::string Sales_data::isbn(const Sales_data *const this)
{return this->isbn; }

````

`this` is a pointer to `const` means that `const` member functions
cannot change the object on which they are called. isbn may be called
but not write to the data members of the objects on which it is
called.

Object that are const, and references or pointers to const objects,
may call only const member functions.

#Class Scope and Member Functions

The compiler processes classes in two steps, the member declarations
are compiled first, after thich the member function bodies are
processed. <e,ber function bodies may use other members of their class
regardless of where in the class those members appear.

#Defining a Member Function outside the Class

Member definition must match it;s declaration.
-Return type
-Parameter list,
-Name must match the declaration in the class nody

Name of a member defined outside the class must include the name of
the class of which it is a member.

````c++
double Sale_data::avg_price() const{
       if (units_sold){
       	  return revenue/units_sold;
       }else{
	  return 0;	
       }
}
````
