Why does `read` define it's Sales_data parameter as a plain reference
and `print` define it's parameter as a reference to `const`?

For `read`, we are intended  store the infomation from istream into the
reference Sales_data.

For `print`, We just need to printout the member data. We will not
need to modify any data, so we can pass into a `const`.
