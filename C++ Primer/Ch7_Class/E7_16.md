What, if any, are the constraints on where and how often an access
specifier may appear inside a class definition? What kinds of members
should be defined are a public specifier. What kinds should be
private?

No constraint on the number and location of the access specifier.

The specified access level remains in effect until the next access
specific or the end of the class body.

The interface should be defined public. Data member and implementation
are private.
