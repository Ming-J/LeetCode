What is encapsulation? Why is it useful?

Encapsulation separated the implementation from the interface. It
hides the implementation details of a type.

A class that is encapsulated, the user need not to know how it works,
they can regard class as a type.

User code cannot inadvertently corrupt the state of an encapsulated object.

The implementation of an encapsulated class can change over time
without requiring changes in user code.
