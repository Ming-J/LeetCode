It is legal but redundant to refer to member through the `this`
pointer. Discuss the pros and cons of explicitly using the `this`
pointer to access members.

Pro:
* It is much more clear by using `this` to refer members
* The parameters in member function can have the same name as the data
members if we use this pointer to refer data member.

Con:
* The code will look redundant
